title: boxfile.yml
---

The `boxfile.yml` is a yaml config file housed in the root of your project that defines what components should exist in your app and all configuration related to your appâ€™s deployment and infrastructure. It allows you to custom-configure your app's environment to your project's specific needs.

#### Important Things to Know About the Boxfile
- Boxfiles are required to use Nanobox.
- Your boxfile must be named `boxfile.yml` in order to be recognized.
- The `boxfile.yml` must be placed at the root of your project's repo.
- The boxfile must be valid yaml markup. You can brush up on your yaml at [yaml.org](http://yaml.org/start.html) or check your syntax at [yamllint.com](http://www.yamllint.com/).
- In a local Nanobox dev app, application components are created and destroyed by adding and removing them from your boxfile. In production, components can only be removed through your dashboard.

####Sample Boxfile
```yaml
code.build:
  engine: ruby
  config:
    runtime: ruby-2.2
  lib_dirs:
    - vendor

code.deploy:
  transform:
    - 'bundle exec rake fix-yaml'

web.site:
  nickname: front-site
  start: 'bundle exec puma -c config/puma.conf'
  network_dirs:
    data.storage:
      - usr/uploads

worker.jobs:
  start: 'ruby workers/image_processor.rb'
  network_dirs:
    data.storage:
      - usr/uploads

data.db:
  image: nanobox/postgresql

data.storage:
  image: nanobox/gluster

data.queue:
  image: nanobox/redis
```

## The Boxfile Structure

Your app is made up of components. A component is a piece of your app's infrastructure tasked with a specific function. Each component is configured separately in the Boxfile.

Yaml is used in the Boxfile because of its simplicity and clarity when defining relationships between data. A component's configuration is indented and nested under the component ID. Each level and relationship of data is defined by indentation.

#### Boxfile Structure

```yaml
web.site: #<-------------------- Component ID
  start: 'rails s'          #|
  network-dirs:             #|-- Component Settings
    data.storage:           #|
      - usr/uploads         #|


data.postgres: #<--------------- Component ID
  image: nanobox/postgresql #|
  config:                   #|-- Component Settings
    version: 9.4            #|
                            #|
```

#### Things to Note About yaml
- **Yaml is very picky about indentation**. Indentation is what is used to define the relationship structure of information in your Boxfile.
- **Tabs are not valid yaml**. All indentation should be done using double spaces.

### Component IDs
Every component in your app has a component ID which consists of two parts:

- Component Type - [web, worker, or data](#component-types).
- Unique identifier - Completely up to you.

Component IDs must be unique.

#### IMPORTANT: Component IDs Cannot be Changed
Component IDs cannot be changed once a boxfile is deployed and the components are created. If they are changed, they will be recognized as new components.

#### Component IDs
```yaml
# Pattern
type.unique-identifer:

# Examples
web.site:
web.api:
worker.jobs:
worker.image-processor:
data.db:
data.storage:
```

### Component Types
There are three types of components:

- **web**: A code component with publicly accessible ports.
- **worker**: A backend code component with no publicly accessible ports.
- **data**: A component that houses data of some sort.

### Component Nicknames
Each web, worker, and data component can be given a nickname. The nickname is what displays as the component label in your dashboard.

#### nickname
```yaml
web.site:
  nickname: front

data.db:
  nickname: front-db
  image: nanobox/postgresql
```

#### Nickname Restrictions
The following restrictions apply to component nicknames:

- Can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes
- Cannot start or end with a dash
- Connot contain consecutive dashes

## Sections of the Boxfile
Boxfiles consist of a handful of sections or "nodes": code.build, code.deploy, dev, web, worker, data. These are covered in detail in the next few docs, but here are some quick descriptions:

[`code.build`](/boxfile/code-build/) - Defines the build, environment, and configuration for web and worker components.

[`code.deploy`](/boxfile/code-deploy/) - Defines deploy hooks and possible code transformations.

[`dev`](/boxfile/dev) - Defines settings unique to your [local nanobox dev environment](/local-dev/).  

[`web`](/boxfile/web/) - Defines settings unique to each web component.  

[`worker`](/boxfile/worker/) - Defines settings unique to each worker component.  

[`data`](/boxfile/data/) - Defines settings unique to a specific data component.
