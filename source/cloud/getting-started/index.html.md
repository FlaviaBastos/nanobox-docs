Nanobox Cloud's purpose is to provide a streamlined workflow between local development and production environments as well as a simple way to manage and scale complex infrastructures. The bulk of Nanobox Cloud lives within the [Nanobox dashboard](https://dashboard.nanobox.io). The rest of the functionality is identical to the local Nanobox development tool.

This collection of docs provides information about the Nanobox dashboard, CLI tools, and functionality unique to Nanobox Cloud.
