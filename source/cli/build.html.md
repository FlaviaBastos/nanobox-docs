The `build` command builds your app's runtime and loads dependencies (when applicable) and packages them into a deployable runtime. This process uses settings and [build hooks](/app-config/build-deploy-hooks/#build-amp-compile-hooks) specified in the `code.build` section of your boxfile.yml.

### Usage
```shell
$ nanobox build
```
