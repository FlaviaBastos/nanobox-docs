title: Installing the CLI

Nanobox provides auto-installers to make installation as simple as possible. These can be downloaded from the [Nanobox Downloads page](https://desktop.nanobox.io/downloads).

#### Installer Options
Nanobox utilizes Vagrant & Virtual Box to provision virtual environments on your local machine. If you already have these installed locally, you can opt-out of including them in the Nanobox installer. Just uncheck the option to include them on the downloads page.

#### Homebrew on OSX
If you have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/) installed, you can use it to install Nanobox.

```bash
$ brew cask install nanobox
```
