title: dev reset
---

The `dev reset` command resets the dev VM registry.

The VM registry stores information about the app that is running and apps that have run in your Nanobox VM. In some cases, stale data can prevent your VM from shutting down. Running this command will reset the registry and allow the Nanobox VM to shutdown.

### Usage
```bash
$ nanobox dev reset
```
