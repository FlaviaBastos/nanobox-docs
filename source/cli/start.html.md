title: start

The `start` command starts the Nanobox Virtual Machine. While this command can be called explicitly, it is implicitly called in the [`dev up`](/cli/dev/up), [`dev start`](/cli/dev/start/), [`sim up`](/cli/sim/up/), and [`sim start`](/cli/sim/start/) commands.

### Usage
```bash
$ nanobox start
```
