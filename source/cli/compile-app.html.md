---

The `compile-app` command compiles your application code into a deployable package. This process uses settings `run.config` section of your boxfile.yml.

*For most cases, you will never need to run the `compile-app` command directly. It's implied in the `deploy` command.*

### Usage
```shell
nanobox compile-app
```
