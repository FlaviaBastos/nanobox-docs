App SSH keys give you the ability to SSH directly into any of your app's servers and/or containers.

## Viewing Your App's SSH Key
In your application dashboard, go to "Admin" > "Security". Here you are provided with the IPs of each server/container in your app, an example connection command, and your app's private SSH key.

_**Note:** In team apps, only team members with the role of "Owner" or "Admin" can view App SSH keys._
