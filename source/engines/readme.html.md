title: Readme
---

An engine's Readme information is contained in a `README.md` file in the root directory of the engine. It should include a summary of what the engine is, document how to use it, and outline what configuration options are available to users. The contents of the Readme are shown on the engine's landing page on [engines.nanobox.io](https://engines.nanobox.io).

#### Github Flavored Markdown
All Readme should be written in Github Flavored Markdown (GFM), a variant of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) that introduces helpful functionality such as fenced code blocks and syntax highlighting. Markdown is designed to make writing and publishing content as easy as possible. If you're new to GFM, the following links provide a great crash course:

#### A Readme is Required to Publish an Engine
In order to [publish an engine](/engines/publish/), it must contain a `README.md` file in the root directory of the engine. 

## README.md Content Template
For a README.md content template, check out the [`README.md` in the engine template project](https://github.com/pagodabox/nanobox-engine-template/blob/master/README.md).
