title: Printing Output
---

Every engine should be informative to the application developer about what it's doing. Nanobox provides a [styleguide](/engines/style-guide) for formatting output, which should always be followed for consistency. In addition to provide a styleguide, Nos provides convenient helper methods to implement the styleguide.

#### Warning

You should be familiar with the [styleguide](/engines/style-guide) before continuing.

## Usage

#### Printing a Header

To print a [main section header](/engines/styleguide#main-section-header), Nos provides a `print_header` function. This function accepts a single argument, which is the header title. The header will be formatted to 70 characters, uppercased, and centered.

Example:

```bash
print_header "headline here"
```

Would produce:

```text
::::::::::::::::::::::::::: HEADLINE HERE :::::::::::::::::::::::::::
```

#### Printing the start of a process

To print a main section header, indicating the [start of a process](), Nos provides a `print_process_start` function. This function accepts a single argument, which is the header title. The header will be formatted to 70 characters, uppercases, and left-aligned.

Example:

```bash
print_process_start "installing ruby-2.2"
```

Would produce:

```text
INSTALLING RUBY-2.2 ------------------------------------------------>
```

#### Printing the end of a process

To print the end of a process, Nos provides a `print_process_end` function. This function does not accept any arguments, and will create a delineation of the process with a hard newline.

#### Printing the start of a sub-process

To print a header, indicating the [start of a sub-process](), Nos provides a 'print_subtask_start' function. This function accepts a single argument, which is the header title. The header will be formatted to 40 characters, uppercased, and left-aligned.

Example:

```bash
print_subtask_start "after build hook 1"
```

Would produce:

```text
AFTER BUILD HOOK 1 -------------------->
```

#### Printing the end of a subtask

According to the styleguide, a subtask is terminated by printing either a success or failure message. The following functions: `print_subtask_success` and `print_subtask_fail` are provided by Nos, and do not take any arguments.

Example 1:

```bash
print_subtask_success
```

Would produce:

```text
   [âˆš] SUCCESS
```

Example 2:

```bash
print_subtask_fail
```

Would produce:

```text
   [!] FAILED
```

#### Printing a bullet

To print a [bullet]() item, Nos provides a `print_bullet` function. This function accepts a single argument, which is the line to print in a bullet style.

Example:

```bash
print_bullet "Language Detected : Ruby"
```

Would produce:

```text
+> Language Detected : Ruby
```

#### Printing bullet information

When printing [follow-up]() information to a bullet, Nos provides the `print_bullet_sub` function. This function accepts a single argument, which is the line to print.

Example:

```bash
print_bullet_info "Language Detected : Ruby"
```

Would produce:

```text
   Language Detected : Ruby
```

### Printing bullet sub-item

When printing a [sub-item]() to a bullet, Nos provides the `print_bullet_sub` function. This function accepts a single argument, which is the sub item to print in a bullet style.

Example:

```bash
print_bullet_sub "Language Detected : Ruby"
```

Would produce:

```text
   - Language Detected : Ruby
```

#### Printing a warning

When printing a [warning message](), Nos provides a `print_warning` function. This function accepts a single argument, which is the warning message. The message is formatted to a 70 character block paragraph.

Example:

```bash
print_warning "We've detected you may be using... (abbreviated for clarity)"
```

Would produce:

```text
-----------------------------  WARNING  -----------------------------
We've detected you may be using sessions in a way that could cause
unexpected behavior. Feel free to review the following guide for
more information : bit.ly/2sA9b
```

#### Printing a fatal message

When printing a [fatal message], Nos provides a `print_fatal` function. This function accepts 2 arguments: The title, and the message. The title will be uppercase, and the message will be formatted to a 70 character block paragraph.

Example:

```bash
print_fatal "deploy stream disconnected", "Oh snap... (abbreviated for clarity)"
```

```text

Oh snap the deploy stream just disconnected. No worries, you can
