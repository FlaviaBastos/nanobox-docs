You will receive an email at the email address you provided with a confirmation link. Click the link to confirm your account. That's it! You've created an account on Nanobox.

### Didn't Receive the Confirmation Email?
If you didn't receive the confirmation email, do the following.

#### 1. Check your junk/spam boxes
We do our best to keep our emails out of these, but sometimes this is where they end up.

#### 2. Make sure the email address you provided is correct
Whatever email address you provided will show in your browser after you submit the account creation form. If the email address is incorrect, you can "reset" the account and provide a new email address.
