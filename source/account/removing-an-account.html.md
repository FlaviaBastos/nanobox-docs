title: Removing an Account
---

While we hate to see anyone leave Nanobox, we understand that sometimes an account just needs to be removed. In order to remove your account, you must first remove yourself as a team member from all apps or, if you’re the apps’ sole owner, delete the app(s).

To delete your account, go to Account Admin > Account Management. Once your user is no longer associated with any apps, you’ll be given the option to unlock the delete button. Click “Unlock”, “Delete this user”, then type in your username and click “Delete User Forever!”.
