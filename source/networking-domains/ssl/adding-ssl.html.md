title: Adding SSL
---

Normally the process of adding SSL to your app is tedious complicated, but at Nanobox we've tried to make it as simple as possible. To get started, click on the "Network" tab of your application dashboard and go to "SSL Certificates". Then click "Add an SSL Certificate".

You have three different options when adding a new certificate:

- [Import an Existing Cert](#import-an-existing-cert)
- [Use LetsEncrypt](#use-letsencrypt)
- [Key & Install a 3rd Party Certificate](#key-amp-install-a-3rd-party-certificate)

## 3 Different Ways of Adding SSL
### Import an Existing Cert
Fill out the fields - Key, Cert, CA

### Use LetsEncrypt
Fill out info, hit submit, we do the rest

### Key & Install a 3rd Party Certificate
Fill out info, submit your CA to your SSL provider, they send you a key and a certificate authority

## Intermediate Certificates
This should be included in your CA
