Nanobox is built to work across Mac, Windows, and Linux platforms and system requirements are minimal. What determines these requirements is which [provider](/local-config/configure-nanobox/#provider) you decide to use to manage virtualization. Your provider is selected in the initial Nanobox setup process and the [`nanobox configure`](/cli/configure/) process.

[Native Docker Requirements](/install/requirements/docker/) *(Recommeded for Linux)*  
[Docker Machine & Virtual Box Requirements](/install/requirements/docker-machine/) *(Recommended for MacOS & Windows)*
