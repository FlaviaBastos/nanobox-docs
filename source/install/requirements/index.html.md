Nanobox is built to work across Mac, Windows, and Linux platforms and system requirements are minimal. What determines these requirements is which [provider](/local-config/nanobox-config-yml/#provider) you decide to use to manage virtualization. Your provider is selected in the initial Nanobox setup process, in the [`nanobox configure`](/cli/configure/) process, or by manually updating your `~/.nanobox/config.yml`.
