*First, make sure all [installation requirements](/install/requirements/) are met.*

Nanobox provides a Windows installer to make installation as simple as possible.

## Download the Nanobox Installer
The Nanobox installer can be downloaded from the [Nanobox download page in your dashboard](https://dashboard.nanobox.io/download).

### Installer Options
When running Nanobox, you can either use native Docker containers or run containers in a light-weight virtual machine (VM) ([Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)). If you plan to use the light-weight VM, you can download Nanobox bundled with Virtual Box. If Virtual Box is already installed on your machine or you plan to use native docker containers, you can just download the Nanobox package.

**Note:** For MacOS, we recommend using Nanobox with a light-weight VM.

## Run the Nanobox Installer
Once you've downloaded the Nanobox installer, run it and it will walk you through the entire installation process.
