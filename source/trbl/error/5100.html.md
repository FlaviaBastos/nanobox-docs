## The Issue
LetsEncrypt requires that your domain be pointed to the server on which the certificate is being installed in order to valid domain ownership. If your domain isn't pointed to your app yet, LetsEncrypt won't be able to validate the domain and issue the certificate.

## Steps to Take

### Cancel the Sequence
While Nanobox will continue to hit the LetsEncrypt API, there's a change the domain status will not change. The best thing to do is to cancel the process. To cancel a process, click the "Cancel" button in the upper-right corner of the process viewer.

### Point Your Domain to Your App
In order for the LetsEncrypt challenge to pass, your domain must be pointed to your app. For the provided app-name.gonano.io domains, this is done automatically, but if you're using your own custom domain, instructions are provided in the [Using Custom Domains](/domains-networking/custom-domains/) doc.

Keep in mind that changes to your domain do take time to propagate. To keep propagation times down, turn down your your domain's "Time to Live" (TTL) before updates.

### Try it Again
Once your domain is routing to your live app, try to create the LetsEncrypt bundle again and it should succeed.
