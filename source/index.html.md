# Nanobox Documentation

Welcome to Nanobox! First off, a little history â€“ We are developers who had to learn infrastructure and knew it could be easier. Nanobox is the result of lessons learned through years of successfully (and unsuccessfully) building, managing, and scaling production application platforms. Our goal is to help you avoid the pitfalls and time-loss that come with building, managing, and scaling yours.
