Security and encryption are incredibly important and a must for most apps. Nanobox makes adding and managing SSL certificates as simple as possible. The next few docs walk through how to add and manage SSL certificates with Nanobox.

### Every App Gets a LetsEncrypt Certificate
Every app launched through Nanobox gets a dev url (app-name.gonano.io) with an SSL certificate installed. We use [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) generate these SSL certificates.

*You can also use LetsEncrypt to generate a certificate for your own custom domain. This is covered in the [Adding SSL](/domains-networking/ssl/adding-ssl/) doc.*
