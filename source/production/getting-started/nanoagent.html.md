Every Nanobox app includes a 'nanoagent' service. NanoAgent serves many purposes necessary for running your app as well as providing visibility into your app. Below is just a few of the things NanoAgent does:

- Resource Usage Aggregation & Reporting
- Log Aggregation & Historical Log Storage
- Code Builds
- Library Archive Storage
- Git Repo Storage

*The NanoAgent service is required and cannot be removed from an app.*
