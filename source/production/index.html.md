# Nanobox Production

Nanobox is designed to make provisioning local virtualized environments and developing within those environments extremely simple. Nanobox Production allows you to take the very same environment and code and deploy them to production servers on established, trusted cloud-hosting providers.

Nanobox Production provides perfect pairity between local development and production environments by using the same [Nanobox engines](/getting-started/) to provision services and deploy code. It comes with dashboard that lets you manage production apps and infrastructure, providing everything from service resource usage statistics, data backups, cron jobs, scaling, and much more.
