title: Deploy Code
description: The process of deploying code to a production app with Nanobox is simple and ensures that if it works locally, it'll work in production.
---

With an [app launched](/production/launch-app/), you're ready to deploy to it.

## Compile Your Code
Before deploying to a live app, you need to compile your code. This creates a deployable code package than can be deployed by Nanobox.

```bash
# compile your code into a deployable package
$ nanobox compile
```

**Note:** If your [built runtime](/cli/build/) isn't up to date with your boxfile.yml, this will also build a new runtime.

#### .nanoignore
In order to keep your compiled code package as small as possible and upload times short, we recommend adding a `.nanoignore` file to the root of your project. Here you can specify files to omit from compiled code. More information is available in the [.nanoignore documentation](/local-dev/local-config/nanoignore/).

## Test Locally
The Nanobox CLI `sim` command provisions a simulated production environment in your local Nanobox container. Deploys into your a sim environment work exactly like a full production deploy. If it works in sim, it will work in production.

```bash
# Start your sim environment
$ nanobox sim start

# Add a convenient way to access your sim app from your browser (optional)
$ nanobox sim dns add app-name.sim

# deploy your built runtime & code package into sim
$ nanobox sim deploy
```

Visit and test your app in your browser at `http://app-name.sim`.

*More information about the `sim` command is available in the [`sim` documentation](/cli/sim/).*

## Link
In order to deploy your code to your production environment, you need to link your local codebase to your live app. This is done using the `link` command.

```bash
# cd into the root of your local project
$ cd app-dir

# link the project to your live app
$ nanobox link app-name
```

For more information about the `link` command, view the ['link' documentation](/cli/link).


## Deploy to Production
The `deploy` command will deploy your newly built runtime and compiled code to your live server(s).

```bash
$ nanobox deploy
```
