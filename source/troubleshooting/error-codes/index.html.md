title: Error Codes
---

Nanobox automates complex tasks through "sequences" - processes that do everything from deploying code and installing environment variables to migrating data. On occasion, sequences do error. When errors occur, Nanobox will output an error code specific to the issue that caused the failure to occur.

## Error Information
Each error will include an error code with a link to the corresponding doc, meta information with details pertinent to the error, and the error stack trace. These are all helpful when troubleshooting the error. The error meta and stack trace can be viewed by clicking on the "View Full Stack Trace" link in your sequence viewer.
