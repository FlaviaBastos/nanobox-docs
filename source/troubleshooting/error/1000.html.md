## Check the Network
This error may be caused by Nanobox's inability to connect to the server on your hosting provider. To check network connectivity, try the following.

### Console into a Component on the Server
Run the following console command to attempt to console into a component running on the affected server.

```bash
# Attempt to open a console using the nanobox cli
nanobox console component.id
```

### Ping the IP of the machine
Another way to check connectivity is to attempt to ping the affected server. The IP to ping is included in the meta data of the error.

```bash
ping <machine IP>
```

### Check with Your Provider
If you're unable to successfully console into or ping the server, check with your hosting provider. They should be able to tell you if the server is up, down, or affected by an outage.
