title: Creating an App

**Note:** To create an app, you must first setup a hosting provider. This process is covered in the [Hosting Providers doc](/getting-started/providers/).

To get started, click the "Create New App" button in your dashboard.

### Name Your App
Next, provide a name for your app. If no name is provided, we will generate one for you.

### Select Your Provider
Last, select your provider and region. This is the infrastructure on which your app's server(s) will be provisioned.

Once saved, we will provision an empty app server using your provider account. When you're ready, you can [deploy your codebase to your app](/getting-started/deploy/).
