title: Deploy Code
---

With an [app launched](/getting-started/launch-app/), you're ready to deploy to it.

## Link
In order to deploy your code to your production environment, you need to link your local codebase to your live app. This is done using the `link` command.

```bash
# cd into the root of your local project
$ cd app-dir

# link the project to your live app
$ nanobox link app-name
```

For more information about the `link` command, view the ['link' documentation](/cli/link).

## Build & Compile
In order to deploy code with Nanobox, you must first build a runtime and compile your code. Th `compile` command will do both if a runtime has not yet been built.

```bash
# build runtime & compile code
$ nanobox compile
```

This will run everything associated with your app's [code.build](/app-config/boxfile/code-build/) and generate a runtime and code package that can be deployed to your app.

## Deploy
The `deploy` command will deploy your newly built runtime and compiled code to your live server(s).

```bash
$ nanobox deploy
```
