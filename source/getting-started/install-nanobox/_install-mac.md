Nanobox provides a Mac installer to make installation as simple as possible. It can be downloaded from the [Nanobox Downloads page](https://desktop.nanobox.io/downloads).

#### Installer Options
Nanobox utilizes [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) & [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) to provision virtual environments on your local machine. If you already have these installed locally, you can opt-out of including them in the Nanobox installer. Just uncheck the option to include them on the downloads page.

## Run the Nanobox Installer
Once you've downloaded the Nanobox installer, run it and it will walk you through the entire installation process.

## Homebrew on OSX
If you have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/) installed, you can use it to install Nanobox.

```bash
$ brew cask install nanobox
```
