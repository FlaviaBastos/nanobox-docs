Nanobox provides a Windows installer to make installation as simple as possible. It can be downloaded from the [Nanobox Downloads page](https://desktop.nanobox.io/downloads).

#### Installer Options
Nanobox utilizes [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) & [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to provision virtual environments on your local machine. If you already have these installed locally, you can opt-out of including them in the Nanobox installer. Just uncheck the option to include them on the downloads page.

## Run the Nanobox Installer
Once you've downloaded the Nanobox installer, run it and it will walk you through the entire installation process.

## Optimize Nanobox <span class="rec"></span>
Once Nanobox is installed, it's recommended that you configure and optimize the Nanobox container. These optimizations are covered in the [Local Performance Tuning](/local-dev/local-performance/) doc.
