**Note:** To launch an app, you must first setup a hosting account. This process is covered in the [Hosting Accounts doc](/account/hosting-accounts/).

To get started, click the "Launch New App" button in your dashboard.

### Name Your App
Next, provide a name for your app. If no name is provided, we will generate one for you.

### Select Your Provider & Region
Last, select your provider/hosting account and region. This is the infrastructure on which your app's platform and server(s) will be provisioned.

Once saved, we will provision an empty app server using your provider account. When you're ready, you can [deploy your codebase to your app](/getting-started/deploy-code/).
